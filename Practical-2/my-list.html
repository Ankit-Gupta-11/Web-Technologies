          It is the most popular and traditional yogurt-based drink from the north-western region of Punjab in India.
          There are several varieties of lassi such as mango lassi, salted lassi, sweet lassi, bhang lassi, and
          chocolate lassi. It is a cooling, refreshing and healthy drink that is the best choice for summers.

          Tea along with Filter coffee is a preferred drink for many people. Many Indians like to have tea in the
          morning or during evening. I know some people who get a headache if they donâ€™t get their daily cuppa of tea.

          In India, many herbs and spices are added to the tea. Each family has their own version of making tea. This
          recipe shows how to make masala chai when you do not have Masala tea powder. You just need a few whole spices.
          I have also shared this detailed post of Herbal tea to know more about the spices which are generally added to
          Indian tea.

          Chaach is a Rajasthani drink, best as natural thirst satisfiers. It is one of the smoothest, tastiest
          and relishing drinks. This buttermilk or slightly sour milk is best for hot seasons.
        </p>
        <div class="paragraph-break"></div>

        <p class="item-text">Although chaach can be made from fresh yogurt (curds/dahi), it is more commonly made at
          home
          from yogurt that is a few days old and has become sour due to age. Indeed, one of the purposes for making
          chaach at home is to usefully finish off old yogurt that is lying in the fridge for long. Such chaach has a
          tangy, slightly sour taste which is considered delicious. A pinch of salt is usually added to it for further
          enhancement of taste, and other seasonings can be added also, as described below.</p>
